# HealthAd README.md

## Overview

HealthAd is a chatbot designed to provide health-related information and assistance.

**Key Features:**

* **Conversation History:**  The bot keeps track of past interactions, allowing users to revisit previous questions and responses.
* **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts to save their chat history and personalized experiences.
* **Interactive Interface:**  HealthAd is built to be user-friendly with a clear text input field for questions and interactive responses.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Dependencies:** Install the required packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies.)
3. **Configuration:** Create a configuration file (`config.json`) to specify settings such as database connection details and API keys.

4. **Database Setup:** Initialize the chatbot's database using `db_setup.py`: `python db_setup.py`

## Usage

* **Run the Chatbot:**  Execute the main Python script (`app.py`) to start the HealthAd chatbot: `python app.py`.
* **Interact with the Bot:** Type your health-related questions or requests in the provided text input box. The bot will generate responses based on its knowledge base and natural language processing capabilities.
